# Graphics - Problem 6

**Goal**
- Gain further experience with graphics objects

**Instructions**

Using the graphics library, develop a Python program to draw the a set of LEGO bricks. The desired output is shown below.

**Alternatives**
- One long program - just a sequence of draw commands. This will get you the basic points
- Instead of creating each object using a class from the library, clone a previously created object and use the move method to form the next brick. This is still long and tedious, but it shows use of "advanced" functionality. Bonus points for this.

**Bonuses**
- Using cloning.
