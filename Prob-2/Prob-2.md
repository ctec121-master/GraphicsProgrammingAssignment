# Graphics - Problem 2

**Goal**
- Read and understand an existing program
- Updated an existing program to new specs

**Instructions**
- The current program draws a circle on the screen, then with each subsequent mouse click it moves the circle to a new location.
- Update the program to draw squares instead of circles
- Have each successive click draw an additional square on the screen (rather than moving an exisiting one).
- Use the click point as the lower left corner of the square
- Upon exiting the for loop print a message on the window, "Click again to quit" and wait for the final click before closing the window.
- Comment your code. The previous problem asked for you to comment every line. That is not required here. Instead break the code into sections of related code and put a comment on the top of each section. Make sure there is a blank line between sections of code.

**Bonus**
- Add a second for loop after the first one that uses the click point as the center of the square. This will require some additional calculations to generate the coordinates of the points for the square.
