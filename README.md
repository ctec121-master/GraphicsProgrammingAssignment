# Graphics Module Problems

This repository contains the files for the module on graphics. There are 7 problems:

1. An exercise in commenting existing code.
2. Update existing code to new specs.
3. Create an archery target.
4. Code a program that uses user interaction to create a drawing of a house.
5. Code a program that Uses various graphic objects to draw a car.
6. Code a program that draws lego bricks of different colors.
7. Code a program that draws a face.

NOTE: Even though the Python files are in subfolders, the program runs from the root directory. What this means is, if graphics.py isn't installed centrally on your machine, you need to copy it to this folder, not the subfolders where the code is.
